unsigned char* load(char* path) - creates an unsigned char array containing either RGB or RGBA, this is currently limited to raw RGB or RGBA data and uncompressed color-mapped images, TGA files can hold other formats, and I may expand this to handle those in the future, I've done it before.

SDL_image_builder.c is a test script that used SDL to rebuild the image from the extracted RGB/RGBA data, might be helpful
